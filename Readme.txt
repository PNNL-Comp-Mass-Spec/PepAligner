PepAligner

The PepAligner program can read a file containing peptides and align
them to a file of protein sequences (.Fasta or delimited text) using 
Smith-Waterman alignment.

Example input file is TestPeptides.txt.  Processing these peptides against
Shewanella_2006-07-11_Excerpt.fasta produces output files
TestPeptides_output.txt and TestPeptides_output_summary.txt
